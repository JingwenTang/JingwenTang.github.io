Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] (IOE) at the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor], where I am very fortunate to be advised by [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~shicong/ Professor Cong Shi]. My current research interests lie broadly in learning algorithms and data-driven optimization. Specific topics include *sequential decision-making under uncertainty* and *online reinforcement learninng algorithms*, especially their applications in *supply chain management* and *revenue management*. \n
Before joining Umich, I studied [https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/ Industrial Engineering] at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University]. \n
