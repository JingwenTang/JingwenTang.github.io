== About me
Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] (IOE) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor [https://umich.edu/]. I am advised by [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~shicong/ Professor Cong Shi]. My current research interests lie in *online learning and adaptive decision-making*. Topics include combining optimization techniques with reinforcement learning algorithms and data-driven statistical learning algorithms, especially their applications in *supply chain management and revenue management*. \n
Before joining Umich, I studied [https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/ Industrial Engineering] at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University].
