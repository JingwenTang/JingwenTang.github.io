Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at the [https://www.herbert.miami.edu/faculty-research/academic-departments/management/index.html Department of Management] at [https://www.herbert.miami.edu/ Miami Herbert Business School], [https://welcome.miami.edu/ University of Miami]. \n\n
Before joining the University of Miami, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research from the Department of [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] (IOE) at the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor], where I was very fortunate to be advised by [https://congshi-research.github.io/ Professor Cong Shi]. I earned my Bachelor's degree in [https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/ Industrial Engineering] from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University].\n\n
My current research interests lie broadly in learning algorithms and data-driven optimization. Specific topics include *sequential decision-making under uncertainty* and *online and offline learning algorithms*, especially their applications in *supply chain management* and *revenue management*. \n
