    \item ``\href{https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/msom.2022.0323}{Online Learning for Dual Index Policies in Dual Sourcing Systems}'', \\ \textbf{Jingwen Tang}, Boxiao (Beryl) Chen, Cong Shi, \emph{\textbf{Manufacturing and Service Operations Management}}. \\
    {\it Winner of University of Michigan IOE Richard C. Wilson Prize for Best Student Paper.}
  
  %\textit{Outline}: We propose a two-layer nonparametric learning algorithm to approximate the optimal dual-index policy for the dual-sourcing inventory system with backlogged demand. The algorithm admits an optimal regret bound and integrates stochastic bandits, sample average approximation techniques, and simulation-based methods in a seamless and non-trivial fashion.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item ``\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4781604}{Multiproduct Inventory Systems with Upgrading: Replenishment, Allocation, and Online Learning}'', \textbf{Jingwen Tang}, Izak Duenyas*, Cong Shi*, Nan Yang*\footnote{* Authors are listed in alphabetic order. }, under review. 

  
  
  %\textit{Outline}: We study a feature-based pricing problem with demand censoring in an offline data-driven setting. Through the lens of causal inference, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm that is motivated by survival analysis and doubly robust estimation. We quantify the theoretical regret and also demonstrate the efficacy of this proposed approach in large-scale numerical experiments.
  
	\item ``Remunerating Newsvendor Problem
in a Two-Sided Market'', \\ \textbf{Jingwen Tang}, Cong Shi, Izak Duenyas.  
	
  %\textit{Outline}: We introduce a new model, the “remunerating newsvendor” problem, which extends the classical price-setting newsvendor problem to incorporate remuneration decisions in two-sided markets. We propose a new algorithm called Bandit Bisection Search (BBS) to solve the incomplete information problem for which matching upper and lower regret bounds are established.

  
  
  %\textit{Outline}: We first characterize the structure of the clairvoyant optimal joint ordering and allocation policy in a multiproduct system with general upgrading with full information. We then solve the problem with demand learning via a novel online learning algorithm termed stochastic gradient descent with a perturbed gradient (SGD-PG) approach that achieves an optimal regret bound. 	 

  %\item ``Multi-product Pricing under the Multinomial Logit model with Vanishing Choices'', \\ \textbf{Jingwen Tang}, Cong Shi, Yuqian Xu, to be submitted with draft available.

  %\textit{Outline}: We study a multiproduct dynamic pricing problem in continuous time under capacity constraints with a vanishing choice set, using the MNL model with heterogeneous parameters to model the customer choice. We propose an asymptotic optimal heuristic with a $\sqrt{\theta}$ upper bound for the expected revenue discrepancy when the size of the problem scales proportionally to $\theta$. 

  %\item ``Fairness in Inventory Control'', \\ \textbf{Jingwen Tang}, Boxiao (Beryl) Chen, Cong Shi, to be submitted with draft available.
  
  %\textit{Outline}: We tackle the multi-location inventory control problem from a centralized perspective without prior knowledge of demand distributions accounting for service rate fairness. We propose an online learning algorithm that effectively maintains fairness levels with high probability and achieves a tight regret bound with censored demand.
